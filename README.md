# md2notion

WIP; do not eat.

Convert markdown to a vector of Notion blocks for the [notion-client](https://lib.rs/crates/notion-client) Rust library.

The complicated Markdown test file is from [this repo](https://github.com/mxstbr/markdown-test-file).

## Development

If you have the `just` command runner installed, run `just setup`. If you prefer not to use just, the only thing that matters is having a nightly installed so you can run `cargo +nightly fmt` to make imports formatted the fussy way I like.
